LCC Clock Display for te Adafruit Feather M4 with CAN
This is based pn the Adafruit example for CAN.
  It implements a Fast Clock Display for the feather M4 using the \
  Broadcast Time Protocol in the NMRA LCC Stamdards.
It is refertred to as a Lurker because it does not register with LCC, it just watches
the traffic on the LCC network to grab messages that it needs.
